                  Generic medicines contain the same active ingredient and are
                  equally effective and medically equivalent as the branded
                  products but are available at a lower price. Generic
                  manufacturers have to demonstrate that they are medically
                  identical to the branded product - i.e. they offer the same
                  quality, strength, stability and effectiveness.

                  Viagra is the most well-known treatment for adult men with
                  erectile dysfunction, sometimes known as impotence. This is
                  when a man cannot get, or keep a hard, erect penis suitable
                  for sexual activity. Viagra pills have been used to treat
                  erectile dysfunction for over two decades and been proven to
                  be very effective for more than 80% of men. Sildenafil (also
                  known as sildenafil citrate) is the generic version of Viagra
                  and is medically equivalent.

                  Viagra works for most men and has been shown to help
                  approximately 4 out of 5 men get and keep erections hard
                  enough for sex. The effectiveness of Generic Viagra is
                  identical to Viagra.
